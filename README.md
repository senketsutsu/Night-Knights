# Night-Knights

## Introduction
At first glance, the world seems to be a safe place. No conflicts, no danger, just harmony. Everyone can be
whoever they desire to be. Some (students) want to discover all the wonders of the world. Driven by the thirst
for knowledge, they study all day in libraries and share their discoveries. But at night they have to fight for
their lives like the doughtiest of knights. This seemingly perfect world changes as the sun goes down. Suddenly,
dangerous predators (chavs) crawl from the darkness, waiting for the defenseless. Students walking on the
streets are a perfect prey for them. Despite the danger, they have to be there. After all, after the whole day
of studying, they have to eat or drink something. Otherwise, they would die.
